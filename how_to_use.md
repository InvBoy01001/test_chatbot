# 🤖 LLM-Based Agentic Chatbot System - User Guide

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated **LLM-based agentic chatbot system** that intelligently routes user conversations to specialized agents based on intent classification. The system simulates Large Language Model capabilities for intent understanding while providing real-time routing and agent communication.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
User Message → Intent Agent → Intent Classification → Route to Specialized Agent → Agent Response
```

### **Core Components:**

1. **Intent Agent** (Port 8000): Central router with simulated LLM intent classification
2. **Support Agent** (Port 8001): Handles technical issues and troubleshooting
3. **Billing Agent** (Port 8002): Manages billing, payments, and account issues
4. **General Agent** (Port 8003): Provides general information and FAQ support
5. **Human Agent** (Port 8004): Handles escalations and complex requests

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- FastMCP library

### **1. Setup Environment:**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install fastmcp
```

### **2. Start All Agents:**
```bash
# Use the startup script (recommended)
python start_all_agents.py

# Or start manually:
start python intent_agent.py          # Port 8000
start python working_support_agent.py # Port 8001
start python working_billing_agent.py # Port 8002
start python working_general_agent.py # Port 8003
start python working_human_agent.py   # Port 8004
```

### **3. Test the System:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python test_llm_system.py

# Or test individual components
python test_individual_agents.py
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### **Interactive Demo:**
```bash
python demo_client.py
```

This launches an interactive chat interface where you can:
- Type messages and see real-time intent classification
- Watch the routing process in action
- Receive responses from specialized agents

### **Example Conversations:**

#### **Technical Support:**
```
You: My app keeps crashing when I open it
System: 🎯 Intent: Support (Confidence: 0.39)
       🚀 Route To: support_agent
       🤖 Support Agent: Detected application crash. I've restarted the application and cleared temporary files. Please test again.
```

#### **Billing Issue:**
```
You: Why was I charged for a subscription I canceled?
System: 🎯 Intent: Billing (Confidence: 0.7)
       🚀 Route To: billing_agent
       🤖 Billing Agent: I've verified your account and found the charge. This appears to be for an active subscription. Please check your subscription status.
```

#### **General Inquiry:**
```
You: What are your business hours?
System: 🎯 Intent: General Inquiry (Confidence: 0.3)
       🚀 Route To: general_agent
       🤖 General Agent: Our support team is available 24/7 for urgent technical issues. General inquiries are handled Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM EST.
```

#### **Human Transfer:**
```
You: I have a legal question about your terms of service
System: 🎯 Intent: Human Transfer (Confidence: 0.7)
       🚀 Route To: human_agent
       🤖 Human Agent: I understand you have a legal question. I'm Sarah Johnson, Senior Support Specialist. I'll be happy to assist you with your legal inquiry. How can I help you today?
```

## 🔧 System Features

### **Intent Classification:**
- **Support**: Crashes, errors, bugs, performance issues, functionality problems
- **Billing**: Charges, payments, subscriptions, refunds, account issues
- **General Inquiry**: Business hours, information requests, FAQ questions
- **Human Transfer**: Legal questions, complaints, escalations, complex requests

### **Confidence Scoring:**
- High confidence (0.7+): Clear intent, immediate routing
- Medium confidence (0.3-0.6): Probable intent, routing with verification
- Low confidence (<0.3): Default to Human Transfer for expert assistance

### **Smart Routing:**
- Automatic intent detection based on keyword analysis
- Context-aware agent selection
- Fallback mechanisms for unclear requests
- Real-time agent communication

## 📊 Testing and Validation

### **Automated Testing:**
```bash
# Run all system tests
python test_llm_system.py

# Test individual agents
python test_individual_agents.py

# Test specific functionality
python test_simple.py
```

### **Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Intent classification accuracy
- ✅ Routing logic validation
- ✅ Agent communication verification
- ✅ End-to-end flow testing
- ✅ Error handling validation

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Adding New Agents:**
1. Create a new agent file (e.g., `new_agent.py`)
2. Implement the `handle_request` tool
3. Add routing logic to `intent_agent.py`
4. Update the startup script

### **Modifying Intent Classification:**
Edit the `classify_intent` function in `intent_agent.py`:
- Add new keywords
- Adjust confidence scoring
- Modify routing logic

### **Enhancing Agent Responses:**
Each agent can be customized with:
- More sophisticated logic
- Database integration
- External API calls
- Machine learning models

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Agents Not Starting:**
```bash
# Check if ports are available
netstat -an | findstr :800

# Kill existing processes
taskkill /f /im python.exe

# Restart agents
python start_all_agents.py
```

#### **Tool Registration Errors:**
- Ensure all agents are running
- Check tool decorator syntax
- Verify function signatures
- Restart problematic agents

#### **Connection Failures:**
- Verify all agents are listening on correct ports
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Verify FastMCP installation

### **Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Test individual components
python test_simple.py
python test_minimal_client.py

# Check agent status
python -c "import asyncio; from fastmcp import Client; asyncio.run(async def test(): async with Client('http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse') as c: print('Intent Agent OK')); test())"
```
